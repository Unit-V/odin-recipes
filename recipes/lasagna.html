        <h2>Discription</h2>
        <p>One of the most loved foods in the world! This is a lasagna made the traditional Italian way, with a slow cooked ragu and a b√©chamel sauce ("Besciamella"). No ricotta - that's the American-Italian version. Though it requires patience to make, it is worth every minute. The ragu bolognese is melt-in-you-mouth tender and the sauce is rich and thick. Makes 8 giant or 10 normal servings</p>
