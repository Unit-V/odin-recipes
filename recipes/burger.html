<h2>Description</h2>
<p>There are those of you who might be wondering why you need yet another burger recipe, and then there are those who just can't get enough. This burger from Jamie Oliver's Comfort Food is for both of you: it delivers classic flavor all juiced up and a little weird, in a wonderful way. Oliver takes the traditional components and gets kinda nutty with them, adding slight twists that really do make this a worth-a-try-even-if-you're-sick-of-burgers burger.</p>
<h2>Indigredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>1.75 lbs chuck steak</li>
<li>1 large red onion</li>
<li>4 brioche buns</li>
<li>4 tsp yellow mustard</li>
</ul>
<p>Steps</p>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat.</li>
    <li>In a medium bowl, mix together the ground beef, egg, and garlic. Mix in steak sauce until mixture is sticky feeling. Form into 3 or 4 balls, and flatten into patties.</li>
    <li>Grill for about 10 minutes, turning once, or to your desired degree of doneness. The internal temperature should be at 180 degrees F (82 degrees C) when taken with a meat thermometer. Serve on buns with the usual trimmings.</li>
</ol>
